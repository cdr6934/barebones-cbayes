          I am a creative technologist, tinkerer, and artist. I love to create
          things and explore the world around me. I am always looking for new
          ways to express myself and share my ideas with others.

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>
          My interests have spanned many different subjects. From nature, art, history, and technology. 
          And sometimes that seems to be a bit overwhelming from my brain. Yet it is in the intersections of 
          this where the most interesting parts  of my life are found. 

          <ul>
            <li>Art</li>
            <li>Emerging Technology</li>
            <li>History</li>
          </ul>
