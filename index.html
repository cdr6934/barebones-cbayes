          I am a data scientist, creative technologist, tinkerer, and artist. I love to create
          things and explore the world around me. I am always looking for new
          ways to express myself and share my ideas with others. I've

        <h2>The Vision</h2>
        <p>
          First off I completely own that the vision is crazy. I am not sure if it is even possible. But I am going to try.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love all things art, science and technology. I find that the most interesting and fulfilling work comes from when all three meet. 
          Of course it is not to say that they are always friends. But when they are friends they can create something amazing.
        </p>
          The idea is to create a system that can take in data and create art. The art is not the goal. The goal is to create a system that can take in data and create art.

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>
          My interests have spanned many different subjects. From nature, art, history, and technology. 
          And sometimes that seems to be a bit overwhelming from my brain. Yet it is in the intersections of 
          this where the most interesting parts of my life are found.

            <li>Art</li>
            <li>Emerging Technology</li>

  Celestial Collisions - The following series is an exploration of organic textures that embodies the way of a gentle 
  breeze and the simulation of color pencils that randomly generates simple shapes. Out of 380K different combinations of the following combinations,
  an endless amount of orientations can be produced from the piece of work.
